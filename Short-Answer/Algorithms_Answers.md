#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) runtime. The while loop makes it so it will keep growing (a = a + n * n) at the same rate on every pass through until it meets its limit. the graph will show a straight diagonal line. 


b) Linearithmic O(n log n) runtime. as the input increases, the while loop does more loops to satisify its condition. this slightly increases the runtime as inputs get bigger. 


c) Linear O(n) runtime. same speed and growth the whole way through.
